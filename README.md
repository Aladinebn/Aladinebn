### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
hi, i'm Ala Eddine Benna, a passionate self-taught frontend web developer from Tunisia. my passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. i take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

i am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. i learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93163506/215445237-c195881b-447e-403a-9dd6-dd67cf7f5ab5.png)
